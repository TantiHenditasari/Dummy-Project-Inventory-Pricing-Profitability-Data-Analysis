## TOOL USED
This project effectively leverages a suite of Microsoft tools for comprehensive data handling, analysis, and visualization:
- **Power Query (within Excel/Power BI)**: Utilized extensively for robust data cleaning, reshaping, and transformation processes. It ensured the raw data was validated and prepared into a clear, structured, and analysis-ready format.
- **Microsoft Excel**: Employed for in-depth data analysis and extraction, particularly through the use of PivotTables to derive crucial insights into sales performance and profit distribution across various products and categories. Excel's built-in forecasting features were also instrumental in calculating and predicting sales performance for top-selling products and categories, aiding in strategic marketing planning and inventory management.
- **Microsoft Power BI**: The primary tool for developing an interactive and intuitive dashboard. It facilitated the visualization of complex analyses in a clear and easily digestible format. Power BI's capabilities were leveraged to connect diverse data sources and to build enhanced data models (e.g., custom date tables, DAX measures) for deeper data exploration and insightful reporting.
